<h1 align="center">🫁 Lung Cancer Risk Prediction</h1>
<p align="center">
  A Machine Learning project that predicts lung cancer risk based on patient attributes.
</p>

---

## 🔍 Overview

This project utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of lung cancer based on various health and behavioral factors such as age, smoking habits, chronic diseases, and genetic risks. The goal is to assist in early detection and risk assessment through data-driven methods.

---

## 🧠 Features

- Preprocessing of patient data
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualization
- Feature selection and engineering
- Multiple classification models evaluated (e.g., Gaussian NB, Bernoulli NB, Logistic Regression)
- Model performance comparison using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Interactive prediction using test input

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 3.10
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

---

## 📊 Sample Dataset Features

- Age  
- Gender  
- Smoking habits  
- Chronic diseases  
- Genetic cancer risk  
- Fatigue, shortness of breath, coughing blood, etc.
